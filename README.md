## This is the repository for the final assignment of MY472.

### Note for the reviewer:
The repository includes the R markup for the project, the knitted version of the R markup file and a data folder that contains the data saved from API calls and external .csv files.

When you run the R programme, please download the entire repository including the data folder. It should take no more than 5 minutes to run the whole script. The API calls are put in an if(FALSE) block, hence by default it will not run. 

If you were to run API calls, change FALSE to TRUE. Running API calls will take hours and occasional crashes due to server-side errors are expected.

Detailed data processing steps and explanations are included in the comments of code blocks.

### Thank you very much for your time
